# Clusters Trajectories and Quality of Life Longcovicat Symptoms

## Introduction
This project has been developed as the final master's thesis for the Data Science master's program at the UOC (Universitat Oberta de Catalunya). The ultimate goal is to analyze the evolution of Long COVID symptoms over two years and their relationship with the quality of life in adults in Catalonia, through a longitudinal study.

## Contributions
The project has been developed by Brian Silva, with the support of my tutors: Concepci√≥n Violan, Diana Puente, and Laia Subirats.

## Project Structure
The project's code is contained in three R files: 'Limpieza.R', 'Analisis-exploratorio.R', and 'Clustering.R'.

### File Descriptions
- **Limpieza.R**: Contains the code for cleaning and transforming the original data, preparing the dataset for subsequent analysis.
- **Analisis-exploratorio.R**: Includes the exploratory analysis of the data, providing an initial view of the evolution of Long COVID symptoms and their impact on quality of life.
- **Clustering.R**: Applies clustering techniques to identify patterns in Long COVID symptoms and their relationship with the quality of life of the participants.

Finally, the project presents a detailed analysis of the obtained results, highlighting the main conclusions about the evolution of Long COVID symptoms and their impact on the quality of life of adults in Catalonia.
